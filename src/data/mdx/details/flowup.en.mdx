#### Front End
I was a part of core team who developed hybrid application(s) for a client, using **Ionic Framework**.
I co-lead 2 projects with my colleague as in the position of front-end tech lead. We've developed mainly hybrid aplications.

Thanks to technical decisions, tooling and testing, we were able to reuse business logic with Domain driven development approach and refactor single project into Monorepo. 
Main targets were hybrid applications in Ionic and Angular + Angular Universal for web applications.  

##### Highlight
After Proof of concept on Server Side rendering on AWS **Lambda**, I've discovered that single project would require Monorepo approach to fulfill the product roadmap.
Later, single project had evolved into monorepo platform with code sharing, where we were able to onboard another project.

Thanks to technical decisions, a newly developed project with code sharing technique resulted approximately in 200% increase in traffic.

#### Back End

I had an opportunity to research strategies and technologies around **GraphQL**, **AppSync** and **Angular**.
We've developed API with feature toggles in mind.
Also, I gave workshops and internal talks on GraphQL, best practices and advanced techniques.

Thanks to my effort on tooling such as offline serverless development on AppSync, we were able to levarage and onboard other developers into development process and deliver two separate projects thanks to separation of concerns and appropriate serverless setup.

As a next Back End project, we developed serverless solution which aggregated data from different data sources to CMS triggered on cron job.


#### DevOps

I participated in CI/CD and helped to improve pipelines. Such as Bitrise( + Fastlane), Bamboo, tooling automation on CIs.

#### Developer Experience

I actively participated in discussions and meetings to improve overall developer experience and tooling.
Thanks to overall DX, we were able to develop UI components ahead of time and connect it to business logic later.

I provided my team with local offline environment of GraphQL and tooling for development, to prevent clashing on shared Dev environment.

#### Serverless / Cloud

Being active at the company enabled me to get hands on different Cloud providers, namely:

1. AWS as a part of full-time project
1. GCP while participating in study groups and internal projects
1. Firebase while doing PoC, internal projects and tech. researches

#### Other

- I had an opportunity to supervise and co-lead monorepo project.
- Participated and had an iniciative in management and technical meetings that were crucial for products roadmap, delivery, SLOs(service level objective) and SLA(service level agreement).
- Improve my mentoring, public speaking, workshop skills at the company.

- Improve processes in an Agile way and co-introduce Kanban for domain-related tasks.
