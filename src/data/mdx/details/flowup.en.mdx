#### Front End

I was a part of team who developed hybrid application(s) for a client, using **Ionic Framework**.

After Proof of concept on Server Side rendering on AWS **Lambda**, I've discovered that single project would require Monorepo approach to fulfill the product roadmap.
Later, single project had involved into monorepo platform with code sharing, where we were able to onboard another project.

Thanks to technical decisions, a newly developed project with code sharing technique resulted approximately in 200% increase in traffic.

#### Back End

I had an opportunity to research strategies and technologies around **GraphQL**, **AppSync** and **Angular**.
We've developed API with be feature toggles in mind.
Also, I gave workshops and internal talks on GraphQL, best practices and advanced techniques.

As a next Back End project, we developed serverless solution which aggregated data from different data sources on cron job.

#### Developer Experience

I actively participated in discussions and meetings to improve overall developer experience and tooling.
Thanks to overall DX, we were able to develop UI components ahead of time and connect it to business logic later.

I provided my team with local offline environment of GraphQL and tooling for development, to prevent clashing on shared Dev environment.

#### DevOps

I participated in CI/CD and helped to improve pipelines.

#### Serverless / Cloud

Being active at the company enabled me to get hands on different Cloud providers, namely:

1. AWS as a part of full-time project
1. GCP while participating in study groups and internal projects
1. Firebase while doing PoC, internal projects and tech. researches

#### Other

- I had an opportunity to supervise and co-lead monorepo project.

- Improve my mentoring, public speaking, workshop skills at the company.

- Improve processes in an Agile way and co-introduce Kanban for domain-related tasks.
